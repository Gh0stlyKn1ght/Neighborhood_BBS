## 📋 Overview

**Neighborhood BBS** is a fully open-source, decentralized community board and real-time chatroom platform designed to run on affordable, low-power hardware like the **Raspberry Pi**, **Zima Board**, and **ESP8266**. Create a local neighborhood network where residents can share information, ask questions, organize events, and build community connections—all while keeping data local and secure.

**Perfect for:**
- 🏘️ **Neighborhoods** - Local community communication
- 🔐 **Security Teams** - Red teamers, pentesters, bug bounty hunters (see [Kali Linux Setup](KALI_SETUP.md))
- 🔬 **Research Groups** - Secure intelligence sharing
- 🤝 **Teams** - Any group needing offline-first communication

**🏘️ For neighborhoods. By the community. By hackers. Forever open source.**

### ✨ Features

- 💬 **Real-time Chat** - Instant messaging for neighborhood discussions
- 📌 **Community Board** - Post notices, announcements, and requests
- 🏘️ **Local Network** - Works on local networks and mesh networks
- ⚡ **Low Power** - Runs efficiently on Raspberry Pi, ESP8266, and Zima Board
- 🔒 **Privacy First** - Keep neighborhood data local and secure
- 📱 **Web Interface** - Clean, responsive design for all devices
- 🌐 **WiFi Connected** - Easy setup and connectivity
- 📜 **100% Open Source** - MIT License, fully transparent

## 🖥️ Retro Cyan CRT Terminal Theme

All platforms share the **same retro aesthetic**:

- **Cyan on Black** - Classic monospace terminal feel (#00FFFF on #000000)
- **CRT Scanlines** - Authentic monitor effect overlay
- **IRC-Style Chat** - User list, channels, message timestamps
- **ASCII Art Headers** - Nostalgic BBS welcome screens
- **Glow Effects** - Cyan text shadows and highlights
- **Real-time Updates** - WebSocket chat with instant delivery
